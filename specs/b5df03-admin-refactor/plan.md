---

## Phase 1: Foundation - Abstractions & Infrastructure

**Strategy**: Sequential
**Reason**: Later tasks build on these foundation pieces

### Task 1.1: Custom Hooks & Data Layer

**Files**:
- src/hooks/admin/use-resource-manager.ts
- src/hooks/admin/use-resource-manager.test.ts
- src/hooks/admin/use-form-field-renderer.ts
- src/hooks/admin/use-form-field-renderer.test.ts
- src/hooks/admin/use-optimized-query.ts
- src/hooks/admin/use-optimized-query.test.ts
- src/lib/utils/data-transforms.ts
- src/lib/utils/data-transforms.test.ts
- src/lib/actions/utils.ts
- src/lib/actions/utils.test.ts

**Complexity**: L (6h)

**Dependencies**: None

**Description**:
Create the foundational abstractions for admin resource management. This includes custom hooks that extract the repeated patterns from manager components (filtering, delete confirmation, navigation), form field rendering with type safety, and optimized query patterns. Also includes data transformation utilities to centralize Prisma → component interface conversions and generic action wrapper utilities.

This is a complete "Business Logic Layer" unit that establishes the patterns for all subsequent refactoring work.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create `use-resource-manager.ts` hook with filtering state, delete confirmation dialog state, navigation helpers, and empty state logic
2. Write unit tests for `use-resource-manager` covering all state transitions and edge cases
3. Create `use-form-field-renderer.ts` hook providing typed field renderers (text, textarea, date, select) that eliminate type casting boilerplate
4. Write unit tests for `use-form-field-renderer` covering all field types and validation
5. Create `use-optimized-query.ts` hook with query batching and memoization patterns
6. Write unit tests for `use-optimized-query` covering cache behavior
7. Create `data-transforms.ts` with centralized Prisma → component transformations
8. Write unit tests for all transformation functions
9. Create `src/lib/actions/utils.ts` with generic action wrapper utilities
10. Write unit tests for action utilities

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All three hooks implemented with TypeScript generics for type safety
- [ ] Hook test coverage reaches 80%+ (per NFR4)
- [ ] `use-resource-manager` handles filtering, delete dialogs, and navigation for generic resource types
- [ ] `use-form-field-renderer` provides type-safe renderers eliminating casting boilerplate
- [ ] Data transform utilities handle all Prisma → component conversions
- [ ] All tests pass with `pnpm test`
- [ ] Linting passes with `pnpm lint`

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: All code must follow project architecture patterns from CLAUDE.md

- TDD: Write tests first, watch them fail, implement minimal code, watch pass
- Layer boundaries: Hooks are Business Logic Layer, can import Models but not Prisma directly
- Type safety: No `as` assertions, use Zod validation or type guards

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/hooks/admin/ src/lib/utils/data-transforms.test.ts src/lib/actions/utils.test.ts
```

---

### Task 1.2: UI Components & Model Optimizations

**Files**:
- src/components/admin/ui/resource-page-layout.tsx
- src/components/admin/ui/resource-page-layout.test.tsx
- src/components/admin/ui/form-field-group.tsx
- src/components/admin/ui/form-field-group.test.tsx
- src/lib/models/game.ts
- src/lib/models/event.ts

**Complexity**: M (4h)

**Dependencies**: task-1.1 (hooks must exist first)

**Description**:
Create reusable UI components that wrap the new hook patterns and add optimized database queries to eliminate N+1 query problems. The ResourcePageLayout provides standard admin page structure (header, breadcrumbs, actions, empty states). FormFieldGroup wraps AdminFormField with built-in type-safe renderers from the useFormFieldRenderer hook.

Model layer gets optimized queries like `gameModel.findAllWithCounts()` to load participant counts in a single query instead of N+1 loops.

This completes the "Presentation Layer" and "Data Layer" foundation needed for refactoring.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create `ResourcePageLayout` component accepting generic props for header, breadcrumbs, actions, empty state
2. Write component tests for ResourcePageLayout covering all prop combinations
3. Create `FormFieldGroup` component that uses `useFormFieldRenderer` hook internally
4. Write component tests for FormFieldGroup covering all field types
5. Add `findAllWithCounts()` method to `src/lib/models/game.ts` using Prisma aggregation
6. Add `findAllWithCategoryCounts()` method to `src/lib/models/event.ts` if needed
7. Write tests for new model methods verifying query efficiency

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ResourcePageLayout provides consistent admin page structure
- [ ] FormFieldGroup eliminates type casting from forms
- [ ] Component test coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] `game.findAllWithCounts()` eliminates N+1 participant count queries
- [ ] `event.findAllWithCategoryCounts()` optimizes category loading if needed
- [ ] All tests pass with `pnpm test`
- [ ] Linting passes with `pnpm lint`

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: Follow Server/Client component boundaries from CLAUDE.md

- UI Components: Can import Actions and Services (read-only in Server Components)
- Model Layer: Prisma queries only, no business logic
- Testing: Use existing test factories and fixtures

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/components/admin/ui/ src/lib/models/
```

## Phase 2: Validation - Prove Pattern with Events

**Strategy**: Sequential
**Reason**: Validates the abstractions work before rolling out to other resources

### Task 2: Refactor Events Resource

**Files**:
- src/components/admin/events/event-manager.tsx
- src/components/admin/events/event-form.tsx
- src/app/(admin)/admin/events/page.tsx

**Complexity**: M (4h)

**Dependencies**: task-1.1, task-1.2 (requires all foundation pieces)

**Description**:
Refactor the Events resource (manager, form, page) to use the new hook and component abstractions. This proves the pattern works end-to-end before applying to the remaining three resources.

EventManager switches from inline state management to `useResourceManager` hook. EventForm switches from type casting to `FormFieldGroup` component. Events page uses `findAllWithCategoryCounts()` and data transform utilities.

This is the validation checkpoint - if this works cleanly, the pattern is proven for Games, People, and Works.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Refactor `EventManager` to use `useResourceManager` hook for filtering, delete dialogs, navigation
2. Remove duplicated state management code from EventManager (should reduce by ~100 lines)
3. Refactor `EventForm` to use `FormFieldGroup` instead of type casting for all form fields
4. Remove type casting boilerplate from EventForm (should reduce by ~50 lines)
5. Update `events/page.tsx` to use `findAllWithCategoryCounts()` if N+1 queries exist
6. Update events page to use data transform utilities for Prisma → component conversions
7. Test all event CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete
8. Verify performance improvement if N+1 queries were fixed

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] EventManager uses `useResourceManager` hook (no inline state management)
- [ ] EventForm uses `FormFieldGroup` (no type casting boilerplate)
- [ ] Events page uses optimized queries and data transforms
- [ ] All event CRUD operations work identically to before refactoring
- [ ] EventManager reduced by ~100 lines (filtering, dialogs, navigation extracted)
- [ ] EventForm reduced by ~50 lines (type casting eliminated)
- [ ] Manual QA: Create, Edit, Delete flows for events all work
- [ ] Linting passes with `pnpm lint`

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: Maintain Server/Client component boundaries from CLAUDE.md

- EventManager: Client component (uses hooks, event handlers)
- EventForm: Client component (uses useAction for mutations)
- Events page: Server component (async, fetches data directly)

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/components/admin/events/
pnpm dev # Manual testing of all CRUD flows
```

---

## Phase 3: Rollout - Apply Pattern to Remaining Resources

**Strategy**: Parallel
**Reason**: Games, People, and Works resources are independent and can be refactored simultaneously

### Task 3.1: Refactor Games Resource

**Files**:
- src/components/admin/games/game-manager.tsx
- src/components/admin/games/game-form.tsx
- src/app/(admin)/admin/games/page.tsx

**Complexity**: M (4h)

**Dependencies**: task-2 (pattern proven with Events)

**Description**:
Apply the validated pattern to the Games resource. GameManager switches to `useResourceManager`, GameForm switches to `FormFieldGroup`, and games page uses `findAllWithCounts()` and data transforms.

This should follow the exact same pattern as Events refactoring, benefiting from the proven approach.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Refactor `GameManager` to use `useResourceManager` hook
2. Remove duplicated state management code from GameManager
3. Refactor `GameForm` to use `FormFieldGroup` instead of type casting
4. Remove type casting boilerplate from GameForm
5. Update `games/page.tsx` to use `findAllWithCounts()` (eliminates N+1 participant count queries)
6. Update games page to use data transform utilities
7. Test all game CRUD operations
8. Verify 30%+ performance improvement on games page (per NFR3)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] GameManager uses `useResourceManager` hook
- [ ] GameForm uses `FormFieldGroup`
- [ ] Games page uses `findAllWithCounts()` (N+1 query eliminated)
- [ ] All game CRUD operations work identically
- [ ] GameManager reduced by ~100 lines
- [ ] GameForm reduced by ~50 lines
- [ ] Games page loads 30%+ faster with many participants (per spec NFR3)
- [ ] Manual QA: Create, Edit, Delete flows for games all work

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: Follow layered architecture from CLAUDE.md

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/components/admin/games/
pnpm dev # Manual testing of all CRUD flows
```

### Task 3.2: Refactor People Resource

**Files**:
- src/components/admin/people/people-manager.tsx
- src/components/admin/people/person-form.tsx
- src/app/(admin)/admin/people/page.tsx

**Complexity**: M (4h)

**Dependencies**: task-2 (pattern proven with Events)

**Description**:
Apply the validated pattern to the People resource. PeopleManager switches to `useResourceManager`, PersonForm switches to `FormFieldGroup`, and people page uses data transforms.

Follows the same refactoring pattern as Events and Games.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Refactor `PeopleManager` to use `useResourceManager` hook
2. Remove duplicated state management code from PeopleManager
3. Refactor `PersonForm` to use `FormFieldGroup` instead of type casting
4. Remove type casting boilerplate from PersonForm
5. Update `people/page.tsx` to use data transform utilities
6. Test all person CRUD operations
7. Verify all functionality maintained

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] PeopleManager uses `useResourceManager` hook
- [ ] PersonForm uses `FormFieldGroup`
- [ ] People page uses data transform utilities
- [ ] All person CRUD operations work identically
- [ ] PeopleManager reduced by ~100 lines
- [ ] PersonForm reduced by ~50 lines
- [ ] Manual QA: Create, Edit, Delete flows for people all work

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: Follow layered architecture from CLAUDE.md

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/components/admin/people/
pnpm dev # Manual testing of all CRUD flows
```

### Task 3.3: Refactor Works Resource

**Files**:
- src/components/admin/works/works-manager.tsx
- src/components/admin/works/work-form.tsx
- src/app/(admin)/admin/works/page.tsx

**Complexity**: M (4h)

**Dependencies**: task-2 (pattern proven with Events)

**Description**:
Apply the validated pattern to the Works resource. WorksManager switches to `useResourceManager`, WorkForm switches to `FormFieldGroup`, and works page uses data transforms.

This completes the rollout to all four resource types, achieving the DRY improvements and LOC reduction targets.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Refactor `WorksManager` to use `useResourceManager` hook
2. Remove duplicated state management code from WorksManager
3. Refactor `WorkForm` to use `FormFieldGroup` instead of type casting
4. Remove type casting boilerplate from WorkForm
5. Update `works/page.tsx` to use data transform utilities
6. Test all work CRUD operations
7. Verify all functionality maintained
8. Calculate final LOC reduction across all admin resources

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] WorksManager uses `useResourceManager` hook
- [ ] WorkForm uses `FormFieldGroup`
- [ ] Works page uses data transform utilities
- [ ] All work CRUD operations work identically
- [ ] WorksManager reduced by ~100 lines
- [ ] WorkForm reduced by ~50 lines
- [ ] Manual QA: Create, Edit, Delete flows for works all work
- [ ] Total admin section LOC reduced by ~1,400 lines (40% reduction per NFR1)
- [ ] Duplicated logic reduced from 34% to <10% (per NFR2)

**Mandatory Patterns**:

> **Constitution**: Follow layered architecture from CLAUDE.md

**Quality Gates**:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/components/admin/works/
pnpm dev # Manual testing of all CRUD flows
```

## Time Estimates

### Sequential Execution (all tasks one after another):
- Phase 1: 10h (6h + 4h)
- Phase 2: 4h
- Phase 3: 12h (4h + 4h + 4h)
- **Total: 26h**

### Parallel Execution (Phase 3 tasks run simultaneously):
- Phase 1: 10h (sequential)
- Phase 2: 4h (sequential)
- Phase 3: 4h (parallel - max of 4h, 4h, 4h)
- **Total: 18h**

Wait, let me recalculate - if all three Phase 3 tasks run in parallel:
- Phase 1: 10h (sequential)
- Phase 2: 4h (sequential)
- Phase 3: 4h (max of three 4h tasks)
- **Total: 18h**
- **Savings: 8h (31% faster)**

Actually, I need to revise my summary numbers to match this calculation.

---

## Parallelization Strategy

**Phase 1 (Sequential):** Foundation abstractions must be built in order
- Task 1.1 creates hooks and utilities
- Task 1.2 creates UI components using those hooks

**Phase 2 (Sequential):** Pattern validation must complete before rollout
- Task 2 proves the abstractions work end-to-end with Events
- Must complete before Phase 3 to avoid rework

**Phase 3 (Parallel):** Independent resource refactoring
- Tasks 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 operate on separate files (Games, People, Works)
- No shared dependencies - can run simultaneously
- 3-way parallelization: 12h → 4h (8h saved)

---

## Constitution Compliance

All tasks must follow project architecture from CLAUDE.md:

**Layer Boundaries:**
- Models: Prisma queries only, no business logic
- Services: Business logic, can import Models
- Actions: Server Actions with next-safe-action validation
- UI: Components import Actions and Services

**Mandatory Patterns:**
- requireValidatedSession() for all protected routes
- Centralized routes from src/lib/routes.ts
- next-safe-action for all Server Actions
- ts-pattern for discriminated unions
- Zod schemas for all inputs

**Testing:**
- TDD approach per CLAUDE.md testing guidelines
- 80% coverage target (per spec NFR4)
- Use existing test factories and fixtures

---

## Next Steps

### Review Plan
```bash
cat specs/b5df03-admin-refactor/plan.md
```

### Execute Plan
```bash
/spectacular:execute @specs/b5df03-admin-refactor/plan.md
```

This will use git-spice for stacked branches and git worktrees for parallel task isolation.

### Manual Testing Checklist (after all tasks complete)
- [ ] All event CRUD operations work
- [ ] All game CRUD operations work
- [ ] All person CRUD operations work
- [ ] All work CRUD operations work
- [ ] Games page performance improved 30%+ (load with many participants)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
